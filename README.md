# Compressed Sensing LF-DAS

## Introduction
Low-frequency Distributed Acoustic Sensing (LF-DAS) signals play a critical role in in-well sensing applications, including thermal transients, strain changes, flow regime characterization, and event detection. However, conventional fixed low-pass filters often prove suboptimal for extracting these signals. The optimal cutoff frequency can vary significantly along the wellbore‚Äîparticularly in production wells‚Äîdue to spectral non-stationarity, resulting in trade-offs between signal preservation and noise rejection. Furthermore, different physical phenomena in the wellbore generate distinct low-frequency DAS signatures with unique frequency content, often within non-overlapping spectral bins. This work introduces and evaluates a Compressive Sensing (CS)-based methodology designed to adaptively extract LF-DAS signals without requiring a predefined low cutoff frequency, enabling improved signal recovery and noise suppression in dynamic wellbore environments.

## Methods/Procedures/Process: 
The approach leverages the principle that LF-DAS signals, often representing slower physical processes, exhibit sparsity in transform domains like the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Following initial pre-processing, a conservatively high-cutoff filter is applied primarily to remove high-frequency content well above the typical LF-DAS band of interest. The core of the method then employs 2D CS reconstruction. By randomly subsampling the pre-filtered data and solving an L1-minimization problem, the algorithm reconstructs the signal components that best explain the measurements under the sparsity constraint. This inherently favors the dominant, sparse, low-frequency components without enforcing a sharp, predefined frequency boundary, allowing the effective cutoff to be data-driven and spatially variable.

To run with default settings:
```bash
python main.py
```

To customize the run, you may pass optional arguments such as:
```bash

## ‚úÖ Example Use Cases

- Compare LPF and CS-based low filter data extraction methods on clean or noisy DAS data
- Simulate different signal profiles with varying velocities to evaluate robustness
- Visualize compressed vs. original signal performance in both time and frequency domains
- Assess reconstruction quality using RMSE, SNR, and PSNR metrics

## üß™ Notes

- Ensure `chunk_size` is compatible with the total signal length (`fs * time`) for proper segmentation
- Always set cutoff frequencies below Nyquist (`fs/2`) to avoid aliasing
- For rapid prototyping, start with low `fs`, few `n_channels`, and short `time` duration
- The compressed sensing method adaptively determines effective cutoff frequencies based on signal content
- Performance metrics are computed comparing both methods against clean and noisy reference signals
